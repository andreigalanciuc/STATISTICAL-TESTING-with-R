### PROJECT SUMMARY

Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
We will analyze in this project a phenomenon from experimental psychology called the “Stroop Effect”. We will test a hypothesis regarding the outcome task based on a dataset. Here is a brief description of the task: In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.
Seeing an incongruency in the words we’re reading and the color they’re written in makes it harder to name the colors correctly. We make two steps to decipher the names of the colors correctly: 1) Read the word. 2) Realize whether the word matches the color. Hence if there is a mismatch between the ink color and the word, we make a pause until we realize what the actual color should be.
An alternative experiment to test this phenomenon can be done with colored numbers. The method is the same, except that we would have to say the numbers we are reading, instead of words. I think we will see the same results. The times to say the incongruent numbers will be higher than the times to say the congruent numbers.
